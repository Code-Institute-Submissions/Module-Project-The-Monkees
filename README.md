# The Monkees End of Module Project
This project was created as an End Of Module Project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end only 
website for a band. The idea was to showcase the skills we've learned so far in HTML and CSS. 
This project was built as a fanpage for followers of The Monkees. The intended pupose was to showcase the band's music and to inform
users that they are also available to perform at special events. It was also built with the hope of attracting new fans to the band.

## UX
My site attempts to achieve its goal by providing navigation links, on the homepage, to photos of the band, and its members, a discography section
containing some of the band's songs, an events section containing a list of concert dates and also a contact form for those wishing to hire the band.
The footer contains links to various social media accounts, as well as their YouTube channel. 
##### User Stories

My initial desgin idea was have a:
 A ![Home Page](https://github.com/LibbyH52/Module-Project-The-Monkees/wireframes/HomePage.jpg/), containing a large background image of the band, with links and a paragraph of text
 followed by a page about the band ![About the band](https://github.com/LibbyH52/Module-Project-The-Monkees/wirerames/About.jpg/) 
 a ![Music Page](/wireframes/Music.jpg/), 
 this would be followed by an ![Events Page](/wireframes/Events.jpg/), 
 and finally a [Footer](/wireframes/Footer.jpg/).

## Features
#### Existing Features
The site is a single scrolling page with five sections.
The Homepage of my project contains a large background image of the band and informs the user of band's availability to perform at private functions.
There is a Navbar at the top of the page with links to each section of the site and a collapsed navbar for mobile screens. It is also possible to navigate the through 
the site using the browser's scroll bar and the arrow keys on a desktop / laptop computer. 
The site also contains two images sections showing photos of the band and its members. As well as this, there is a discography section with video and audio depicting
the band's work. 
The Contact form contains a submit button to allow users to contact the band.
#### Features Left to Implement
Possibly include a 'Back to Top' button on each section of the site.


## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Javascript, for interactivity

## Testing
I ran checks on my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validator, to check for syntax errors. I also examined the sites at various screen sizes across a number of devices 
using responsive design mode iin Chrome and Firefox. The main issue I ran into here was trying to get the site to stay within its container on the iPhone5s. I also 
filled out the contact form to ensure that the it would not be sent unless the required sections had been filled out and a valid email was essential. 

## Deployment
I deployed my website via GitHub pages. Ialso deployed the code locally using Brackets text editor.
