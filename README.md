# The Monkees End of Module Project
This project was created as an End Of Module Project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end only 
website for a band. The idea was to showcase the skills we've learned so far in HTML and CSS. 
This project was built as a fan page for followers of The Monkees. The intended purpose was to showcase the band's music and to inform
users that they are also available to perform at special events. It was also built with the hope of attracting new fans to the band.

## UX
My site attempts to achieve its goal by providing navigation links, on the homepage, to photos of the band, and its members, a discography section
containing some of the band's songs, an events section containing a list of concert dates, some photos of the band and also a contact form for those wishing to hire the band.
The footer contains links to various social media accounts, as well as their YouTube channel.

## Features
#### Existing Features
The site is a single scrolling page with five sections.
The Homepage of my project contains a large background image of the band and informs the user of band's availability to perform at private functions.
There is a Navbar at the top of the page with links to each section of the site and a collapsed navbar for mobile screens. It is also possible to navigate through 
the site using the browser's scroll bar and the arrow keys on a desktop / laptop computer. 
The site also contains two images sections showing photos of the band and its members. As well as this, there is a discography section with video and audio tracks depicting
the band's work. 
The Contact form contains a submit button to allow users to contact the band.
#### Features Left to Implement
Possibly include a 'Back to Top' button on each section of the site.

examining my site at various screen sizes, in Chrome and Firefox my site was examined on:
* Galaxy S5
* Pixel 2
* Pixel 2 XL

I also filled out the contact form to ensure that it worked as it was supposed to. 
Finally, I clicked on each link in my Navbar to ensure that I was taken to the relevant section.
