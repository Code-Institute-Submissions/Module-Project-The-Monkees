# The Monkees End of Module Project
This project was created as an End Of Module Project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end only 
website for a band. The idea was to showcase the skills we've learned so far in HTML and CSS. 

## UX
This project was built as a fanpage for followers of The Monkees. The intended pupose was to showcase the band's music and to inform
users that they are also available to perform at special events. It was also built with the hope of attracting new fans to the band.
My site attempts to achieve this by providing navigation links, on the homepage, to photos of the band, and it's members, a discography section
containing some of the band's songs, an events section containing a list of concert dates and also a contact form for those wishing to hire the band.
The footer contains links to various social media accounts, as well as their YouTube channel. 
## Features
#### Existing Features
The site is a single scrolling page with five sections. 
The Homepage of my project contains a large background image of the band and informs the user of band's availability to perform at private functions.
There is a Navbar at the top of the page with links to each section of the site and a collapsed navbar for mobile screens. It is also possible to navigate the through 
the site using the browser's scroll bar and the arrow keys on a desktop / laptop computer. 
The site also contains two images sections showing photos of the band and its members. As well as this, there is a discography section with video and audio dipicting
the band's work. 
The Contact form contains a submit button to allow users to contact the band.
#### Features Left to Implement
Possibly include a 'Back to Top' button on each section of the site.


## Technologies Used
For this project I used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (CSS and JavaScript for functionality) 

## Testing
I ran checks on my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validator, to check for syntax errors. I also examined the sites at various screen sizes across a number of devices using responsive design mode iin Chrome and Firefox.
The main issue I ran into here was trying to get the site to stay within its container on the iPhone5s. I also filled out the contact form to ensure that the it would not be sent
unless the required sections had been filled out. 
## Deployment

## Credits
#### Content
I looked up he names of the bands members, as well as the red colour for my h2 header elements, the About Container and the Images Container
on their own website https://www.monkees.com/
#### Media
The images of the band and it's various members was obtained from the Code Institure. The audio files and the vido was also given to us by
The Code Institute. The guitar image, which I used as a background for two of my containers I got from Pixabay.com.
