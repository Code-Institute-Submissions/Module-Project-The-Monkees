# The Monkees End of Module Project
This project was created as an End Of Module Project for the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a front end only 
website for a band. The idea was to showcase the skills we've learned so far in HTML and CSS.

## UX
This project was built as a fanpage for followers of The Monkees. The intended pupose was to showcase the band's music and to inform
users that they are also available to perform at special events. It was also built with the hope of attracting new fans to the band.
My site attempts to achieve this by providing navigation links, on the homepage, to photos of the band, and it's members, a discography section
containing some of the band's songs, an events section containing a list of concert dates and also a contact form for those wishing to hire the band.
The footer contains links to various social media accounts, as well as their YoutTube channel. 
## Features

## Existing Features


## Technologies Used
HTML and CSS (Bootstrap and my own customised CSS page)

## Testing
I ran checks on my HTML code using the W3C validator, to check for syntax errors. I also examined the sites at various screen sizes across a number of devices using responsive design mode iin Chrome and Firefox.
The main issue I ran into here was trying to get the site to stay within its container on the iPhone5s. I also filled out the contact form to ensure that the it would not be sent
unless the required sections had been filled out. 
## Deployment

## Credits
#### Content
I looked up he names of the bands members, as well as the red colour for my h2 header elements, the About Container and the Images Container
on their own website https://www.monkees.com/
#### Media
The images of the band and it's various members was obtained from the Code Institure. The audio files and the vido was also given to us by
The Code Institute. The guitar image, which I used as a background for two of my containers I got from Pixabay.com.
